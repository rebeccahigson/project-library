# Project name: Project-library
Create a library from object in array and dynamically populate HTML elements. Also add options to filer and sort based on object values. 

# The problem
- I started out by coding along with the "dog project" that we went through in the lecture to get the base elements down and updated it so it was relevent to my project. I had to clean up the array a bit since there were some instances of mixed ' and " being used causing image loading errors.

- I wanted to sort the book titles in alphabetical order and ended up using a solution that we tried out in one of our team pratise sessions. If I had more time I would have liked to have a go at the search function but I was struggling a bit with time this week.
